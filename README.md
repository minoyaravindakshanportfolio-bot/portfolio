# Portfolio

This repo contains a simple static portfolio website.

How to use:
1. Customize the files: edit index.html, styles.css, and resume.md.
2. Preview locally:
   - Open index.html in your browser, or
   - Use a simple HTTP server: `python -m http.server` then visit http://localhost:8000
3. Deploy:
   - GitHub Pages: push to `main` (or `gh-pages` branch) and enable Pages from repository settings.
   - Or deploy to Vercel / Netlify for automatic builds.

If you want, I can add:
- Contact form backend (using Formspree or Netlify Forms)
- A React or Next.js version
- CI/CD and automatic deploy on push
- Automatically generated project sections from a JSON/YAML file

Tell me which features you want and I will create a branch and push the files for you.
